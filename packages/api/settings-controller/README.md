# Settings Controller

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-settings-controller` exposes generated `ctx.remote.settings`, `ctx.remote.credentials`, and `ctx.remote.authorization` namespaces for browser configuration surfaces. It returns redacted settings and credential metadata, supports settings and credential writes without returning secret values, opens provider-owned settings or Agent preset locations on the Host desktop, and carries the subscription sign-in a page starts, follows, answers, and cancels. When a provider or seam is absent, the namespace remains registered and returns an actionable configuration error.

## Use this package

Mount this package as a Loader entry in a profile that serves browser configuration. The entry registers all three namespaces independently of their providers so a missing provider produces a named configuration error at invocation, and the authorization namespace answers its own actionable error when no sign-in seam is mounted. Its generated descriptors enter the strict Typert registry, while the settings and credential Definitions remain plain Cordis Services with no wire obligations of their own.

`describe(refs)` answers one map keyed by the requested names, so a settings page describing every reference its rows carry settles those rows together. It accepts at most 64 names per call, reports an invalid name or empty write value as `bad-request`, and copies each answer field by field — a provider returning more than `CredentialInfo` declares cannot widen what crosses. Valid `set(ref, value)` and `unset(ref)` calls report a provider refusal as `credential-rejected`, carrying the provider's message with only the reference in its details. Secret values cross in this direction only: no method here returns one.

`authorization.list()` reports every sign-in flow a mounted flow owner registered, with the provider route its credential key addresses. `authorization.begin(key, method)` starts one attempt and answers its id; `authorization.poll(attemptId, since)` returns that attempt's status, the notices after the caller's cursor, and the prompt it waits on; `authorization.answer(attemptId, promptId, value)` answers exactly that prompt and refuses an answer whose prompt number no longer matches; `authorization.cancel(attemptId)` withdraws the attempt. Attempts live in the Host, one per key, bounded and pruned; no notice or prompt view carries a credential value, and the flow's own `AbortSignal`s stay Host-side.

`settings.describe()` returns deployment facts and every namespace under `redactSecrets: true`. `settings.update`, `settings.replace`, and `settings.mutate` expose the settings service's three write operations and return the namespace's new redacted view; stale writes use `settings-conflict` and other provider refusals use `settings-rejected`.

`settings.openSettingsDocument()` prepares the provider-owned document and opens it with the native text-editor intent. `settings.canOpenAgentPresetDirectory()` reports native-opening availability when the preset page becomes visible. `settings.openAgentPresetDirectory(id)` resolves only a user-authored preset and either opens its directory or returns the path when native opening is unavailable; neither open method accepts a browser-supplied filesystem target.

## Configuration

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `nativeOpen` | platform-detected | Whether Agent preset directories can be handed to a native desktop opener |

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-api-settings-controller) is the exhaustive source for accepted fields and their JSDoc.

## Model Experience

None, as settings and credential configuration are browser and Host state and register no prompt, tool, or session event.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct effect; reading or writing these configuration values does not alter model requests already in flight.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- The batch bound is fixed at 64 references and is not a deployment-configurable field.

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The settings and credential seams own storage and update events, while this package only projects their methods onto the wire.
